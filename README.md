## DESCRIPTION
shacollector is a tool that makes it easy to collect data for problem solving which is included trace logs (ETW), performance logs (perfmon or xperf), event logs and a lot of status information related to SHA area (Storage, Cluster and Hyper-V).

## How to use it
First, specify main options (trace, perf and support) and select sub option that specifies the information to collect. Then, 'trace' and 'perf' can be specified with 'start' to start and 'stop' to stop log collection. The 'support' option collects various status informaiton and logs without specifing 'start' and 'stop'. By default, logs are saved in 'c:\mslog', but you can specify the output destination.

## EXAMPLE
* To collect trace log related I/O drivers (storport.sys, classpnp ...). And change the output folder to 'd:\logs'.
 
      shacollector.bat trace storage start d:\logs
      shacollector.bat trace storage stop

* To collect multiple trace logs. The log files are saved in 'c:\mslog' as the default.

      shacollector.bat trace storport start
      shacollector.bat trace vss start
      shacollector.bat trace storport stop
      shacollector.bat trace vss stop

* To collect performance monitor log. The sample interval is 15sec as the default but it can be change.

      shacollector.bat perf perfmon start
      shacollector.bat perf perfmon stop

* To collect performance monitor log at 1 sec as sample interval. And change the output folder to 'd:\logs'.

      shacollector.bat perf perfmon start d:\logs interval 0:0:1
      shacollector.bat perf perfmon stop

* To collect xperf log for investigating the cpu load. And change the output folder to 'd:\logs'.

      shacollector.bat perf cpu start d:\logs
      shacollector.bat perf cpu stop

* To collect xperf log for investigating the memory exhausion. The log files are saved in 'c:\mslog' as the default.

      shacollector.bat perf memory start
      shacollector.bat perf memory stop

* To collect xperf log for investigating the I/O load. The log files are saved in 'c:\mslog' as the default.

      shacollector.bat perf disk start
      shacollector.bat perf disk stop

* To collect all relevant support information logs such as event logs, registory, dik and network configuration and so on. And change the output folder to 'd:\logs'.

      shacollector.bat support all d:\logs

* To collect specific support information logs (disk, network and event logs). 

      shacollector.bat support disk
      shacollector.bat support network
      shacollector.bat support eventlog
